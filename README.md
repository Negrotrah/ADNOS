ADNOS
---
Hi guys! Well, this project works on Vercel, which already surprised me a lot, at least unlike NuroFlow there are no monolithic files for 3500 lines of code, in ADNOS I managed to split the code, you don't know how glad I am that It was deployed, I did these two projects using CursorAI, so you can visit it via the link https://adnos.vercel.app if it is active. Just don't try to run this on mobile phones:>
